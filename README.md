Step Three: adding inline styles
=================

In this step we will add some styling to the HTML you have just created. Using the style attribute you can add colors(yes the American spelling has to be used or it won't work!), fonts, rounded image edges, background colors and much more! This is called inline styling, we'll get onto using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in the next step :)

#Release One
- Create a file called step_three.html
- As before copy the HTML from [the example file here](https://github.com/amelialaundy/html-css-beginner/blob/step_3/html_example.html) into your step_three file
- Check out what's going on, have a play around and open it in chrome to see changes you make

#Release Two
- Apply some of the styling you see in the example to your about_me file
- With colours you can use the words red, blue, green etc or you can use more specific hexadecimal colours click [here](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colorpicker.asp) to have a look
- If you want to add different fonts have a look [here](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp) for other options, don't worry about the CSS stuff on that page for the moment, just use the names of the fonts you want and apply them to the tag in your HTML where you want that font
- Applying something to the body tag will do that for everything on the page because everything sits inside the body
- Take a look at your file in Chrome to see your handy work!
