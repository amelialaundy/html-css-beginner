Step Two: HTML attributes
=================

In step two will will look at:
- The img tag
- HTML attributes
- Using images from our computer and from the internet
- Creating your own HTML template and adding content
- Using the tags from step one


Look at the HTML in the html_example.html file, use this to create your own HTML document. You can write a short page about you using the four questions or anything else you fancy.

If you have some images on your computer you want to use you can copy them into the folder you are creating your html document in and then use the img tag as shown in html_example.html.

Alternatively you can use any image on the internet, all you need to do is copy the image URL. This can be done by right clicking on your chosen image and selecting Copy image URL and then use that as your img src='' attribute.

#Release One
- Create two new files called about_me.html and step_two.html
- Look at the [example file](https://github.com/amelialaundy/html-css-beginner/blob/step_2/html_example.html)
- Copy & paste the html from the example into step_two.html
- Open this in chrome and see what's happening

#Release Two
- In about_me.html start with the HTML structure: create your html, head, body, header and footer tags. Use the example to get started
- Decide what content you need on your page and where it might go- your four questions and answers, any images or links

#Release Three
- Now you have the basic layout start adding your content
- Remember to open your file in Chrome to see how it all looks!
- Think about how to break it up into sections and paragraphs

#Release Four
- Add in those pictures!
- Use the [example file](https://github.com/amelialaundy/html-css-beginner/blob/step_2/html_example.html) file to guide you
- Have a go at adding links using the 'a' tag and setting the height or width of images using the height and width attributes
- In the next step we'll set about making it look nicer with colours so don't worry too much about the design right now!
