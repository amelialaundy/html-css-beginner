Step One: HTML tags
=================

In Step one we will look at:
- HTML Structure
- Common HTML tags
- Opening and closing tags
- Self closing tags
- Creating lists
- Nesting elements
- Comments

#Release One
- On your computer open Sublime Text 2 and create a new file called step_one.html
- Look at the [html_example.html file](https://github.com/amelialaundy/html-css-beginner/blob/step_1/html_example.html) here on Github
- Copy & paste the html from the hmtl_example.html file on Github into the file you just created (step_one.html) and save it

#Release Two
- Open Chrome and then go to file -> Open File -> and choose step_one.html
- Have a look at what each tag is doing
- Go back into Sublime and play around with the HTML in step_one.html, save your changes and then hit refresh in Chrome to see what has changed
- Try going to a website and right click -> View page source, see if you can recognise what's going on
