Step Two: HTML attributes
=================

In step two will will look at:
- The img tag
- HTML attributes
- Using images from our computer and from the internet
- Creating your own HTML template and adding content
- Using the tags from step one


Look at the HTML in the html_example.html file, use this to create your own HTML document. You can write a short page about you using the four questions or anything else you fancy.

If you have some images on your computer you want to use you can copy them into the folder you are creating your html document in and then use the img tag as shown in html_example.html.

Alternatively you can use any image on the internet, all you need to do is copy the image URL. This can be done by right clicking on your chosen image and selecting Copy image URL and then use that as your img src='' attribute.
